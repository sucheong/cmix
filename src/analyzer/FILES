TIPS                    Pieces of trivia someone has once searched
                        long enough for to think they deserve to
                        be written down.

*.org, *.perl           .org files get processed with the accompanying
                        perl script to produce a .cc source.

*.{cc,h,y,l}            Source files
                        There should have been a table of which files
                        do what here, but it had become really horribly
                        out of date, and I have't enough time to write
                        a new one yet.
