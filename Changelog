   * Changed the handling of lifts of long double (which fails
   on our development machined due to compiler incompabilities).
   The default is now always to truncate lifted values to double,
   except if otherwise explicitly requested. This means that
   speclib.h is now architecture-independent.

   * Improved the memory usage of the speclib when memoising
   values of local variables for program points inside function.
   This means that the interface between p-gen and speclib has
   changed; old generating extensions cannot be used with the
   new speclib and vice versa.

   * Fixed the speclib such that the in-use information is now
   actually used when comparing specialized program points
   inside functions. It has been present since release 2.0.4,
   but the code to test it during memoisation was never
   written. (Embarassing!)

   * Fixed bugs in the code generation for switch statements
   and in the detection of dynamic pointers to specializable
   functions. (Reported Mats Kindahl).

   * Fixed bug in the restructuring phase. (Reported by
   Tetsuro Tanaka).

   * Rewrote much of the declarator parser to fix about a
   dozen rare bugs. Sometimes redeclarations of typedef
   names or declarations of functions returning "pointer
   to function" or "pointer to array" were misparsed or
   rejected as syntax errors.

   * Made the generating extension fail a little more
   gracefully when a stray static pointer to something
   dynamic is dereferenced. This is not a complete solution,
   because things may still go really bad if static pointers
   to something static run wild.

   * `make install' now again strips the installed binaries.
   There is a `make install-strip' as well as a `make
   install-nostrip' for those who want absolute control.

2.0.11: 2000-01-04 17:56 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed a bug that made the restructuring phase of
   p-gen sometimes take exponential time. (Reported
   by Robert R. Henry).

   * Restructured the implementation of `make install' so
   that it works correctly when `install -s' refuses to
   install a script. The old `make install' is now `make
   install-strip', in compliance with the GNU Makefile
   conventions. Thanks to Roman Hodek for pointing out that
   the old code sometimes failed.

2.0.10: 1999-12-15 16:11 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed several bugs reported by Peter Møller Neergaard.

   * Fixed bug where generated identifiers in p_res might
   collide with identifiers declared by the standard
   headers. (Reported by Steen Andersen)

2.0.9: 1999-11-25 18:19 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed bug with infinite recursion in the analyzer when
   certain recursive types was encountered. (Reported by
   Søren Laursen).

   * Fixed bug in the interaction between const and certain
   typedefs. (Reported by Robert R. Henry)

2.0.8: 1999-11-04 17:07 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed bug in the implementation of sizeof(expr)
   (Reported by Steen Andersen)

   * Restructured the test suite to be more flexible and
   more DejaGnu-like

   * Fixed bug in 'producing' specifications for goal and
   generator directives. (Reported by Søren Laursen).

   * The codebase now compiles with HP's aCC compiler in
   addition to GCC.

2.0.7: 1999-10-11 19:06 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Contrary to 2.0.6, this source compiles with GCC
   2.95.1. Thanks to John Gerard Malecki and Peter Makholm
   for helping with test compilations.

2.0.6: 1999-10-06 12:00 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * New `-R' switch to the *generating extension* which
   turns off the restructuring pass.

   * Fixed minor bugs in restructuring code.

   * Made lexical analysis more robust with respect to
   differing end-of-line conventions. Thanks to J. Reyes
   for pointing out that stray CR's could be handled more
   gracefully than as "illegal characters"

2.0.5: 1999-07-20 15:02 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed small oops in release 2.0.4 -- the example
   makefiles installed in $(datadir) did not work.

2.0.4: 1999-07-18 21:30 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Included global liveness analysis that allows functions
   and program points to be shared even when the value of
   some static variables differ, if those static variables
   are not needed by the shared code.

   * The generating extensions are now C programs, as is the
   speclib, so the end user no longer needs a C++ compiler.
   Binary distributions do not depend on a specific C++
   compiler anymore.

   * New, more detailed, user annotations for external
   functions.

   * The speclib now tries to reintroduce structured control
   flow in residual programs. This makes them much easier
   to read.

   * New more intuitive way to control how the example
   makefiles locate the speclib.

   * Better heuristics for choosing an external C
   preprocessor at configuration time. The environment variable
   that overrides it at configure time is now STDCPP rather
   than CPP.

   * Better specialization of conditionals in cases where a
   static operand to a boolean operator sometimes determines
   the result of the test.

2.0.3: 1999-03-08 15:52 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Fixed bug that made cmix crash almost instantly when
   compiled with certain versions of egcs. Thanks to John
   Gerard Malecki for providing debugger traces that helped
   pinpoint this one.

   * Any kind of initializers in the subject program should
   work now.

   * New directive "unsigned chars are glyphs" that controls
   the lifting mode for unsigned char.

   * Abstract types now have an optional signedness attribute
   which helps control how they are lifted.

   * Included makefile and manpage patches from Peter Makholm.

   * Internal tidying-up of the Pgen-speclib interface that
     - allows arbitrary function return types
     - tries harder to avoid mentioning types or variables in
       the residual program before they are declared
     - relies less on C++ features (eventually we'd like the
       genererating extensions to be C programs)

2.0.2: 1999-03-01 19:04 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Minor manual page fixes.

   * Better pretty-printing of residual programs; residual
   variables only get declared if they are mentioned by
   actual residual code.

   * New algorithm for generating residual names. The old
   one had quadratic worst-case behavior (and exhibited it
   in practise, too) and didn't try to guarantee that names
   stayed unique when truncated to 31 letters.

   * Reorganized the speclib so that one only need to link
   with the math library if the subject program uses floating
   point types.

   * Fixed some bugs in the support for heap allocation.

2.0.1: 1999-02-22 19:59 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * By mistake, some files weren't included in the 2.0.0
   tarballs. They should all be here now.

   * Fixed a code generation bug (the value of assignment
   expressions couldn't always be relied on).

2.0.0: 1999-02-22 13:06 Henning Makholm <makholm@diku.dk>

   * Finally after almost two years of rewriting, we proudly
   present C-Mix 2.0.0. If there was a changelog way back
   before we started that, it has been lost in the mists
   of time.
